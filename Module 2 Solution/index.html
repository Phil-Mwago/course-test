<p>A few centuries ago, Charles Darwin stated that only the fittest organism within any biosphere survive competition from other organisms. This meant that for any one species to dominate an ecological niche within any given environment, it has to outcompete other species for the available nutrients. Thus, if you introduce two species to an ecological niche with a limited supply of nutrients such as a phosphate source or water, one species will die out. This is due to competition where the fittest species will survive as of its ability to capture nutrients. This forms the basis of invasion biology where one species outcompetes the other.These involve nutrient enrichment, climatic change, disturbance, species traits, the genetic makeup and diversity.

<p>However, some species co-exist. This is a very delicate relationship in nature. The two different species that coexist do not share a common source of nutrition thus there is no direct competition. For example, in the Masaai Mara and Serengetti in Kenya and Tanzania respectively, one observes that wildebeests and zebras have mastered the art of coexistence. They feed on different parts of the grass available. They also co-exist for protection from common predators such as lions. By definition, an invasive species is an organism that colonizes a new ecological niche and out competes the native species where it has been recently introduced. Most trees within the USA are non-native but have come from distant continents such as Europe as shown in the graphical representation below.

<p>The controlled environments would be the differ in terms of temperature, water application (rainfall) and humidity. The soil content and fertility would be similar across the different experiments conducted. The study would check for differences in growth and overarching in the experiments. From my results, I would have sufficient evidence to confirm the null hypothesis and discredit my alternative hypothesis.
